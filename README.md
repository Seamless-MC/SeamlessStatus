# Seamless Status
A simply lightweight Spigot plugin to manage a Discord bots status displaying server status, players online, etc all is configurable in config.yml  

Currently I am unaware of the functionality of this project as it had been abandoned for years thus changes in Discord's API would most likely break this plugin. I have plans to update and modernize all SeamlessMC plugins to Spigot 1.21.1 by the end of the year

##Example 
BotToken: ''  

# in ticks 240 was the max Discord would allow in 2016 might be less now  

Refresh: 240  

ShuttingDown: 'Server Offline'  

Whitelisted: 'Seamless Factions, Currently Whitelisted {PLAYERS}/{MAX}'  

Normal: 'Seamless Factions, {PLAYERS} players online'
